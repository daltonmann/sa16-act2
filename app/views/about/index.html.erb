            <h2>Professional Biography</h2>
            <p>I worked my first job starting in January of 2021 at a local Mexican restaurant called Elena's
            Taco Shop. After working there for about 8 months, I was promoted from a cashier to a shift leader,
            where I was given more responsibility, and was trusted to be left alone in charge of the restaurant
            for short periods of time. I worked there until August of 2022, where I got a job as a grader
            for a professor at the University of Memphis. I graded for him for a semester and have not had a job
              since then because of a scholarship I received which prevents me from working during the school semesters.</p>

            <h2>Education Background</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Arlington High School in 2021 in the top 5% of my class. I then enrolled in the University
            of Memphis and have been attending since Fall of 2021. I will be graduating in the Fall of 2024 with
            a Bachelor's degree in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I currently have
            a 3.9 GPA. </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I know a few programming languages. Python is my best, but I have had some experience with JavaScript,
            Ruby, and HTML. I also have some experience using Excel. I can also flick a water bottle cap pretty far. Is that a skill? Not sure, but I felt like
            I needed to add something else to this section to fill it out.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>I've been awarded a few scholarships during my time at the University of Memphis, including the Presidential
            scholarship and the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service. Both are competitive scholarships, but the CyberCorps
            is much more so. Only 3 or 4 students are awarded it every semester. It is only given to those who apply
            and demonstrate a strong dedication to cybersecurity.</p>
