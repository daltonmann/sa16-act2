            <h2>Elena's Taco Shop</h2>
            <p>This was my first job and I started there in January of 2021. I was hired
            as a cashier, but after working there for about 8 months, I was promoted from a cashier to a shift leader,
            where I was given more responsibility, and was trusted to be left alone in charge of the restaurant
            for short periods of time. I worked there until August of 2022. I left because I wanted to focus
            more on school.</p>

            <h2>The University of Memphis</h2>
            <p>I got a job as a grader shortly after leaving Elena's.
            I graded for a professor at the University of Memphis named Bill Baggett. I graded for two of his
            Computer Science classes.
            I graded for him for just one semester.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Present Day</h2>
            <p>Since I stopped grading in December of 2022, I have not had a job. This is because I received
            a scholarship that prevents me from working during the school year due to a large stipend
            being attached to the scholarship. </p>
